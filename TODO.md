http://deusexscans.blogspot.com/2014/08/one-turn-kill-of-dark-partisan-vol-1_29.html

H source:
https://teamkoinaka.wordpress.com/

 - Scrape "Type" entry from mangaupdates
 - tagging system

 - revisit gdoc extractor. the extra spaces are annoying
 - lcs diff system instead of levenshtein for change measurement.
 - filter rating view by read and crosslink
 - test for bad del
 - consolidate existence checks

New LN Trans groups:
 - Series system: http://lndb.info/
 - lookup page: http://bato.to/forums/topic/19625-where-can-i-find-recommendations/

Todo:

 - chapter and volume columns
 - volume/chapter tracking, rather then just c
 - request priority sorting

 - custom book synonyms
 - sync reading progress both directions
 - store manga progress locally
 - new books view still fucked
 - search also include full text search
 - feed link to trieview
 - dupscan just kiss
 - Add update time tracking to textscrape.
 - lower request priority for trigram searches

 - mu archive release info
 - mangaeden api

 - custom list page add search for existing item
 - serve compressed HTML
 - tadanohito shutting down  scrape everything
 - use jdownloader api to scrape other h blogs

 - search in rss tags too

 - filter rating view by crosslink status
 - h rating system
 - deduper expose get matching archives for spiral
 - info table position when multiple sources
 - volumeifacator
 - Proper to-download series system
 - autotrim empty dirs
 - Trigger full series download if a series is seen by a scraper, and the local directory is both found, and rated above a threshold (Done for Batoto, needs per-plugin work. Add facilities to pluginBase?)
 - Trigger series download if on any BU list as well (partial)
 - ~~base nt off muid system~~ Axed, MU isn't as encyclopedic as I thought at one point.
 - ability to browse dirs by mu list cross-link
 - select 201 to determine next page
 - add half star rating options
 - h tag collation system
 - consolidation system for h tags
 - ~~out of row colours~~ (Fixed by some low-effort HSV transforms)
 - linebreaks in long filenames in reader popup need work
 - zoom mode indicator for smart mode in reader
 - ability to specify MU id in directory name? [Lnnn] or sommat?
 - way to search for non linked directories - maybe then do levenshtein search for match?
 - import all existing files somehow
 - do some clever set shit to check for misplaced items in directories
 - color code mangaupdates status in reader

 - scan times to deduper for rescanning. Also filesizes
 - Group the smaller scanlators into a single colour-code?
 - artist and author in filebrowser if i have it
 - bu page opens in new window
 - IRC grabber needs a transfer stall timeout.
 - Modularize the side-bar in the manga browser, so the plugins can each provide their own lookup interface if they present the correct API (should be automatically discovered, ideally).
 - Potential race-condition in deduper when two things are scanned by separate threads simultaneously. Add a global "deletion" lock to prevent accidental removal of all copies of file
 - Prevent full base dir refresh on directory rename.
 - prioritize downloads by rating
 - tagging in web interface
 - properly show if things are one shot
 - fork daiz numbering

 - steal code from free manga downloader?

 - most common image browse and filtering system
 	'SELECT COUNT(itemhash), itemhash FROM dedupitems GROUP BY itemhash;'

Deduper R2:

 - ~~deduper spiral out to significant intersections on new scan (Depends on new cleaned-up deduper system)~~ Too much overhead.
 	- Filter spiral aggressively by manga directory?
 - ~~phash filter by resolution for deletion decision~~ (Done)
 - Image entropy is not useful for quantifying image ancestry

Long Term:

 - cover images in file browser?
 - Ability to disable bulk-downloading.
 - Get Watermark-Stripping system running.

<b>Reader</b>

 - fit width only if oversize?
 - make zoom mode pop up last longer
 - fancy fade out when toolbars hidden?
 - Add ability to rename directories to reader (res, name)
 - Add current page position bar when popup menus are visible.
 - Trigger directory cache update if a non-existent directory access is attempted
 - ~~smart zoom mode in overlay~~
 - ~~Make zoom mode a bit more intelligent (e.g. look at aspect ratio to guess zoom mode).~~
 - ~~show current image info~~
 - ~~Chapter read to from BU in item sidebar.~~
 -

<b>File System Organization</b>

 - Coerce directory structure to match MangaUpdates naming.
 - Scrape ALL MangaUpdates metadata, and use that to group series when different sources use different naming schemes. (WIP)
 - Automatically organize and sort directories so each series only has one directory. Aggregate multiple directories so they're named in accord with MangaUpdates
naming approach. Note <b> this makes MangaUpdates the final authority on what to refer to series as. Deal with it</b>

</p>

<b>Nametools Issues</b>

 - ~~Getsurin ni Kiri Saku~~
 - ~~Imasugu Onii-chan ni Imouto da tte Iitai!~~
 -
Bad MangaUpdates Links:

 - I think these are fixed by the latest NameTools patches.
	 - ~~Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka~~
	 - ~~neko ane~~
	 - ~~rescue me~~
	 - ~~maken-ki!~~
	 - ~~murcielago~~
	 - ~~Keyman - The Hand of Judgement~~
	 - ~~Okusama ga Seito Kaichou! [+++][EE] npt linking~~
	 - ~~Log Horizon - Nishikaze no Ryodan not linking properly~~
	 - ~~'Hero Co., Ltd.' link only working one way~~
 - ~~Add testing to nametool system~~ (Done, wasn't the problem source)
 - ~~Everything is getting sorted into '[zion]'~~ Fixed, it was a scraper bug. Derp
